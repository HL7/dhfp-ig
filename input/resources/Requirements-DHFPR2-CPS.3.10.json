  "description": "Identify conditions of clinical interest, identify trends that may lead to significant problems, and provide prompts for clinical decision support.",
  "purpose": "Providing the health care provider with a prompt, notification or alert for identified specific concerns of clinical interest is a cornerstone of Clinical Decision Support. When personal health information is collected directly during a patient visit, input by the patient, or acquired from an external source (laboratory results), it is important to be able to identify and tag potential problems and trends that may be condition- or patient-specific (given the individual's personal health profile), or changes warranting further assessment.\n\nExample(s):\nExamples include: Behavioral risk factors such as tobacco/alcohol use, social history, significant trends (laboratory results, weight); a decrease in creatinine clearance for a patient on Metformin; an abnormal increase in INR for a patient on warfarin; an increase in suicidal ideation; presence of methamphetamines; or absence of therapeutic levels of antidepressants.",
