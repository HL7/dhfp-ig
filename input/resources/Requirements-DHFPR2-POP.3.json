  "description": "Upon notification by an external, authoritative source of a health risk within the cared-for population, alert relevant providers regarding specific potentially at-risk patients with the appropriate level of notification.",
  "purpose": "After receiving a notice of a health risk within a cared-for population from public health authorities or other external authoritative sources:*Identify and notify individual care providers or care managers that a risk has been identified and requires attention; and *Provide suggestions on the appropriate course of action.\n\nA care provider now has the ability to decide how patients are notified, if necessary. For example, this function may be used after detection of a local outbreak of hepatitis A, advising providers of the at-risk population and potential prophylactic treatment. A second example might be the dissemination of new care guidelines for elderly patients with a specific chronic disease.\n\nNotifications to clinicians or patients may occur by telephone, email, FAX or other methods.",
