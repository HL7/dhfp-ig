  "status": "active",
  "description": "Manage medical, procedural/surgical, mental health, substance use, social and family history. This includes pertinent positive and negative histories, patient-reported or externally available patient clinical history.",
  "purpose": "The history of the current illness and patient historical data related to previous medical diagnoses, surgeries and other procedures performed on the patient, clinicians involved in procedures or in past consultations, and relevant health conditions of family members is captured through such methods as patient reporting (e.g., interview, medical alert band) or electronic or non-electronic historical data. This data may take the form of a pertinent positive such as \"The patient/family member has had...\" or a pertinent negative such as \"The patient/family member has not had...\". When first seen by a health care provider, patients typically bring with them clinical information from past encounters. This and similar information may supplement locally captured documentation and notes wherever appropriate. Information regarding the patient's living situations may be an important means for a provider to uniquely identify a patient or to identify illnesses that may occur within a given proximity. Information regarding past or present living situations or environmental factors related to the patient or the fetal death may include a description of the father's type of occupation and occupational demographic information (such as the name and location of the employment). For example, it may be important for the clinician to know that the patient works in an occupation where lead exposure is common. It may also be important for the clinician to know that the patient lives in a household where asbestos routinely appears on clothing.",
