  "purpose": "The system promotes the reduction of medication errors at time of administration and at the point of care by positive patient identification, by checks on drug identification including name, dose, route and designated time of administration. Access to drug monograph information may be provided to allow providers to check details about a drug and enhance patient education. Medication administration includes the administration of medication therapies such as chemotherapy. Workflow for medication administration is supported through prompts and reminders regarding the “window” for timely administration of medications.",
