The EHR should accommodate, at a minimum, the following possible recommendations for future care (or dispositions) along with other supporting information for the recommendations:\n- discharge,\n- admission,\n- transfer,\n- death,\n- left without being seen (LWBS),\n- left without treatment (LWOT),\n- elopements (i.e. leaving without notifying the facility or wandering),\n- left against medical advice (AMA),\n- patients triaged to other clinics, and \n- administrative errors.",
